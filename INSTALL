Build Instructions

 Hyves Desktop uses CMake (http://cmake.org). We also use large chunks of the
 KDE extensions to CMake, but those are packaged.

 * You need to have Automoc installed. Automoc is available from kdesupport 
   (http://websvn.kde.org/trunk/kdesupport/automoc/).
 * You first need to build and install QCA to your Qt directory.
